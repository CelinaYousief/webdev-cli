# webdev-cli

A simple bash script for generating and editing HTML.
This is in progress so I will add more capability as I go.

## Installation

I will get an installation script going eventually but for now:

Copy ```webdev``` into one of the following:

  ```$HOME/bin``` for access by your user only.

  ```/usr/local/bin``` for access by all local users.

  ```/usr/local/sbin``` for access by root only.
